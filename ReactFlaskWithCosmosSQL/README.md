### Frontend

The frontend is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The most important scripts in the `package.json` are:
  - start: serves the frontend in development on http://localhost:3000/.
  - build: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
  - publish: Builds the app for production and moves the output to the `publish` folder.
  - test: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

To start the frontend application manually:
  1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder path.
  2. Use `yarn install` or `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
  3. Use `yarn start` or `npm start` to start frontend app in development.

### Backend

The backend is based on [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).

To start the backend application manually:
  1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder path.
  2. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install backend dependencies.
  3. Use `python3 server/server.py || python server/server.py || py -3 server/server.py` to start backend app in development. It is served on http://localhost:3001/

### Cosmos Database

**DO NOT share the keys publicly.**

The Cosmos database will take approximately 5 minutes to deploy.
Upon completion of deployment, a notification will appear in VS Code and your connection string will be replaced.

Additional documentation can be found here: [Web Template Studio Cosmos Docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/services/azure-cosmos.md).

## Deployment

To deploy the application in an Azure App Service follow the deployment instructions:

- [Deployment using Web Template Studio Deploy command](https://github.com/microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/generated-apps/deployment.md)

Consider adding authentication and securing backend API's by following [Azure App Service Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-security).
